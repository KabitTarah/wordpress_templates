# AnkiDeVotD - Goals for this class:
#     X Get full list of verbs from wordpress -- WPT library will handle this
#     X Figure out which week we're in (based on number of verbs posts / verb list)
#     X Get the latest DeVotD yearly deck
#     X Figure out the latest verb available in DeVotD anki deck
#     * Update media for new cards from Forvo library
#     * Update decks for all verbs since latest available
#     * Update decks on Google Drive
